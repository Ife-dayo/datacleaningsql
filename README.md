# datacleaningsql
A data cleaning project in SQL that prepares the Nashville Housing dataset for analysis.


I made use of different statements, CTE and window functions to perform data cleaning.

#### Statements and functions used include
- SELECT
- FROM
- COUNT
- WHERE
- ALTER
- UPDATE
- SELF JOIN
- SUBTRING
- CHARINDEX
- PARSENAME
- CASE WHEN
- WITH
- ROW_NUMBER()
- OVER()
- ORDER BY
- DROP COLUMN


#### Data cleaning steps:
1. Standardize Date Format
2. Populate Property Address Data
3. Check for null values
4. Break out Address Columns into individual Columns(Address, City, State)
5. Change Y and N to Yes and No in SoldVacant Column
6. Remove Duplicates
7. Remove Unused Columns
